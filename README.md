# Homework 5 Work Day Scheduler

For this homework I developed a work day scheduler that dynamically tracks each hour of the day. This can be used for keeping track of your daily schedule or for determining what you want to do at a given hour.


## Requirements for this assignment

 - display current day
 - time block layout
 - can enter events
 - color coding for each hour
 - time indication for each cell
 - local storage capabilities

 each of these requirements were met with full functionality
